### [Project Description](doc/Proj1_desc.md)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Fall 2020

+ Projec title: **How Does Education Evolving Play a Part in the Election?**
+ This project is conducted by **Mubai Liu**

+ Project summary:The election in America has been through almost a century, over such a long period, things changed dramatically. Take education for example, back in the year of 1948, there’s not much people who had a college degree and the system of education was not even comparable to today’s system. This kind of change of time could influences people so much that even the voting behavior may shift from one party to the other as we are going to discuss in this analysis blog. For the purpose of discussion, we are mainly focusing on the White Americans and the two main parties in America: Democrats and Republicans. We may answer a few questions listed below to make the purpose more clear:

1. Is there a change in how White American’s high educated/low educated people vote for the party?

2. If so, what are the potential factors of such a phenomenon?
