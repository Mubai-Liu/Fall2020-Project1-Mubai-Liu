# 1. Background and Introduction

As the time has come to 2020, the education evolved so much in the past centuries. It seems that nowadays the Republican Party would rather cut off the education or any other supporting fees on the program rather than supporting it. (source) On the other hand, the Democratic Party supports the idea of a larger government that is more involved in people’s everyday lives. As more and more programs of supporting the educational resources, the voting behavior of high educational people is under a swift change in the up coming few decades.


The election in America has been through almost a century, over such a long period, things changed dramatically. Take education for example, back in the year of 1948, there's not much people who had a college degree and the system of education was not even comparable to today's system. To partially prove my point of having a huge difference in education over such a long period, here is what I've found using the survey data.

```{r, echo = F, fig.width=10}
anes_edu <- anes_use %>% 
  filter(!is.na(education)) %>% 
  filter(race == "1. White non-Hispanic (1948-2012)") %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  count(education) %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  mutate(prop = n/sum(n))
ggplot(anes_edu,aes(x = year, y = prop, group = education)) +
  geom_smooth(aes(fill = education, color = education), method = "loess", formula = y~x)+
  scale_color_manual('Education level', values = colorspace::diverge_hsv(7)) +
  scale_fill_manual('Education level', values = colorspace::diverge_hsv(7))
  #geom_bar(stat = "identity", colour = "black")
```

We are using the *American National Election Studies* (ANES)'s dataset. ANES are surveys of voters in the U.S. on the national scale. For each presidential election since 1948, ANES collects responses from respondents both before and after the election. The goal of ANES is to understand political behaviors using systematic surveys. ANES's data and results have been routinely used by news outlets, election campaigns and political researchers.

The *Time Series Cumulative Data* of ANES include answers, from respondents from different years, on selected questions that have been asked in three or more ANES' *Time Series* studies. Tremendous amount of efforts have been put into data consolidation as variables are often named differently in different years. 

This kind of change of time could influence people so much that even the voting behavior may shift from one party to the other like we are going to discuss about in this analysis blog. We may answer a few questions listed below to make the purpose more clear:

1. Is there a change of how White American's high educated people vote for the party?
2. If so, what are the potential factors of such phenomenon? Could we conclude that who have benefit the high educated group people will affect their voting result?

# 2. Potential Bias

Although it is a reliable and a credible resource of data, the potential bias inevitably exists. The first is caused by the limitation of sample size.

```{r year barplot, message = F, echo = F, fig.width=8}
barplot(table(anes_dat$VCF0004),
        las=2,
        main="number of respondents over the years")
```


Due to some reasons with either technical or human resources issues, each voting year has a various amount of surveyed data from the lowest `r min(table(anes_dat$VCF0004))` to the highest `r max(table(anes_dat$VCF0004))`, which would cause some boost of total invested people like what happens in 2012. Therefore, we mainly use the proportion as a interests of field to discuss in this blog to eliminated the potential bias. 

Another downside of the survey data is that some variables are asked nearly all the years and some are asked only a few years. This causes that each variable has at least some proportion of NA values. We can see it through the following figure by noticing how much NA values exists. 

```{r NAs, echo = F, fig.width=8}
anes_NAs=anes_dat%>%
  summarise_all(list(na.mean=function(x){
                              mean(is.na(x))}))
anes_NAs=data.frame(nas=unlist(t(anes_NAs)))
ggplot(anes_NAs, aes(x=nas)) + 
  geom_histogram(color="black", 
                 fill="white",
                 binwidth=0.05)+
  labs(title="Fractions of missing values",
       x = "NA values") + 
  theme_light()
```



Therefore, when handling the data, we must avoid directly using the ones with NA values or otherwise it would be problematic for the visualization. 

The variable we care need to be extracted and treated as a categorical data, and for the purpose of analysis, I'll list these variables below:
year
turnout
vote
race
gender
education
income
region
care.win
media.trust
gov.spend






# 3. Education break down

```{r, echo = F, fig.height=14, fig.width=14}

# 4. Would Region be the Explanation?

```{r, echo = F, fig.width = 10}

# 5. Could it be more people not willing to vote?

  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))

```


# 6. What about how much spending the government willing to pay?
```{r, echo = F, fig.height=14, fig.width=14}
anes_spend <- anes_use %>%
  filter(!is.na(gov.spend) & !is.na(education)) %>%

# Conclusion

In conclusion, this might conclude that the voting behavior for white Americans high educational system people have changed a lot.

Despite the fact that the Democratic Party typically promises more government aid programs, most low income white Republicans emphasize family ties and a strong relationship with Christianity and their church to help with their everyday problems, including financial problems, rather than relying on the government. Moreover, their high emphasis on community and values informed by their religion are reflected in their high turnout rate so that they can have a government that supports those values but does not intrude on their community. On the other hand, many low income white Democrats are Christian as well, but religion typically plays less of a role in their lives, and they believe more in government aid like welfare programs.


# Reflection


However, there could be additional variables in the survey we did not explore or even variables that were not in the survey at all that could explain more about these differences in voting behavior. Note that attributes like age, gender, occupation, region, and education levels did not seem to indicate that a person would be more likely to vote Democrat or Republican, but I have omitted this result from the analysis to focus more on differences rather than similarities.

Finally, although we now know more about the demographic differences between low income white Republicans and low income white Democrats, we still do not actually know for sure if these differences are merely correlated with their voting decisions or if they actually cause them to vote the way they do. We would need to use some causal inference techniques on the survey results or look at data other than the survey results to determine actual causal effects on low income white Americans’ voting behavior.
